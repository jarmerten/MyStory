	Once there was 3 little piggys, and they were the best of friends. Other piggys tried to join there friend group but they always pushed them out. They were stubborn and likes the piggy friends they already had. Bob was the muscles, he would beat up any pig that came by to infultrate them. Dale was the smarts of the operation, he pranked all the others and always went unknown. While the last piggy, Alex, laughed at all the ones who got pranked and made them feel bad about themselves.
	Then one day, Miss Piggy Univerise came and everything changed, the piggys let her in and loved her. She was beautiful and they always fought over who got to sleep with her. They all grew up and became the nicest pigs on the farm, always trying to impress Miss Piggy Universe.
	The next night the knews came through, Steve Harvery read the card wrong. Every one couldnt believe it. Immediatly the 3 pigs booted her out of the possy. The news was devasting, and the 3 pigs set out to find the real Miss Piggy Universe.
